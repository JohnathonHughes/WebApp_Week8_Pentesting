# WebApp_Week8_Pentesting

# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection
Description: When viewing users on the blue site in either the "Users" page of the public site or on the "Find a Salesperson" page, the sql command is visible in the end of the URL. To check that the sql query is not being sanitized I added a sleep command to the end of the url. This in turn results in the page waiting a few seconds to load the page and shows us that this site is open to SQL injection.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking
Description: The Blue site allows you to view and edit session ids through the use of the provided url extension "hacktools/change_session_id.php". On the first browser, we log in and copy the session id. When this session id is provided to another person (in this case a different browser on the right), we can change the session id to that of the logged in user. When the page is reloaded, we have successfully signed in without actually do so.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration
Description: After testing various usernames and passwords, a clear distinction is found for a certain case. If we enter a valid username and provided any incorrect password, the response "Log in was unsuccessful" is in bold when it normally appears as plain text. This would allow an attacker to figure out usernames through brute force and finding which cases resulted in the bold text.

Vulnerability #2: XSS
Description: By submitting a XSS scrpit as a public user as feedback, it will not be triggered immediately and thus not scrubbed. Logging in as admin and viewing the feedback page results in the alert created by your script. Since several people have done similar things recently, all of their alerts occur as well.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference
Description: While not logged into the site, a user can view the id associated with each salesperson in the url. Editing the id number allows you to jump between salespeople freely and even allows you to view salespeople who are not listed on the "Find a salesperson" page (such as Lazy Lazyman). This doesn't work on the other sites since whenever you enter the id of someone who a public user should not be able to view, it directs you back to the "Find a salesperson" page instead.
