# WebApp_Week8_Pentesting

# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection
Description: When viewing users on the blue site in either the "Users" page of the public site or on the "Find a Salesperson" page, the sql command is visible in the end of the URL. To check that the sql query is not being sanitized I added a sleep command to the end of the url. This in turn results in the page waiting a few seconds to load the page and shows us that this site is open to SQL injection.
